Absolutely loved the ambiance at Savory Symphony! The roasted duck was cooked to perfection, and the staff was incredibly attentive. A must-visit for any food lover.
What a fantastic experience! The live music perfectly complemented the gourmet dishes, creating a truly symphonic dining experience. The dessert platter is a dream!
Savory Symphony never disappoints! Their wine selection is impressive and pairs wonderfully with their signature seafood dishes. Great spot for a romantic dinner
I took my parents here for their anniversary, and we were all blown away by the quality of the food and service. The chef even came out to greet us!
The brunch menu at Savory Symphony is exceptional. The eggs Benedict with homemade hollandaise is my new favorite.
I was not impressed with the long wait times despite having a reservation. The food was decent, but not worth the hype.
Found the menu to be quite limited and the prices too high for the quality offered. The service was slow, and the waiters seemed overwhelmed.
Had high expectations but left disappointed. The steak was overcooked, and the music was too loud, making conversation difficult.
Not what I expected from a place with such good reviews. The pasta was underseasoned, and the tables were too close together, lacking privacy.
The worst dining experience in a while. The food came out at different times for everyone at our table, and my dish was cold. Will not be returning.
