Neo4J: Sample
Questions 1

Question 1 of 80
To restore a Neo4j instance from a backup, which of
the following is accurate?
A) The Neo4j backups are fully functional
databases. To use a backup, all you need to do
replace your database folder with the backup.
Just make sure the database isn't running
while replacing the folder.
B) The Neo4j "backup-restore" command will copy
the compressed backup archive files and logical
logs to the existing instance database folder, replay
the transactions, and bring the database back
online.
C) Issuing a "restore" command with a timestamp
will recover the Neo4j instance up to that particular
point in time, before any transactions corrupted the
database files.
D) Shut down the current instance, replace the
database folder with the backup, and then startup
the Neo4j instance in recovery mode so the
database is fully recovered.

Question 3 of 80
The following Cypher statement may not return the list
of all employees who work for Acme.
MATCH (a:Employee {id:5})-[:WORKS_FOR]->(b:Company
{name:"Acme"})
RETURN a
LIMIT 10

Select the statement(s) below that describe why the
statement may not return the list of all employees who
work for Acme.
A) We are returning only the variable a; to get the
list of employee names we would have to return
a.name.
￼B) The LIMIT 10 following the RETURN clause
means we will only get 10 results and there
may be more than 10 employees who work at
Acme in the graph.
￼C) We are matching on a node with an
Employee label and with an id property of value
5, which may refer only to a single employee.
D) The LIST keyword needs to be used in the
RETURN statement to generate the list of all
nodes.

of logs to keep to recover a backup into a fully
functioning instance.
C) This configuration will define whether logical or
physical logs will be stored by Neo4j, which will
determine whether a backup can copy data from
memory or from the disk.

incremental backup?
