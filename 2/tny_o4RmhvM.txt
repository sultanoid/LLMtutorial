[Music] foreign [Music] what's up guys this is Ronnie welcome back to our Channel Total technology and Welcome to our new series on unlocking the power of numpy for data science and machine learning so this is going to be a introduction uh video for this series and in this video I'll be going to uh walk through regarding the course outline and very basic like um like introduction about new uh sorry numpy okay so let's get started okay so uh before I actually uh go through the introduction part I just want to actually add few words so uh one more time let me welcome you to our series on the unlocking the power of numpy for data science and machine learning whether you are a novice or experienced practitioner if you want to unlock the power of data science then probably you are at the right place in this uh in this tutorial or you can call it as a series of tutorial we will dive into the Incredible World of numpy and how it can revolutionize your data analysis Journey okay so mastering number is essential for manipulating and analyzing data efficiently right so before I actually start with the actual part don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more exciting data science content uh also join us on this incredible journey and let's unlock the power of data science together this is the introduction part we will talk little bit about the numpy and the course outlined so let's start with the present slide so few words about numpy right so numpy is a short form of numerical python is a powerful library that allows for fast and efficient numerical operation it provides the fundamental building blocks that form the foundation of many popular data science and machine learning Frameworks right okay so we already uh talk about a little bit of numpy and I'll see its definition and what actually numpy can do let's uh move ahead with the next slide which is actually the numpy core features so basically with numpy you can efficiently handle large data set you can perform complex mathematical computation it's uh whether it's multi-dimensional array objects known as ndrs enable you to actually store manipulate and analyze data or maybe larger data phase with ease and maybe you can also save some time okay so next go ahead with the core functionalities or functionality highlights of number so numpy offers a wide range of function and methods for array manipulation statistical analysis linear algebra then image processing and Signal processing right so by leveraging all these functionalities you can actually unleash the full potential of your data science and machine learning project okay next go ahead with the next slide that is the integration capability so our integration with other libraries in addition to its core functionalities you know numpy integrates seamlessly with other python libraries like mac plotly pandas or maybe plotly or c bond or any other stuff also there are some other machine learning libraries are there for example psychic learn tensorflow Pi torch everything everything you can actually integrate with numpy so basically this allows us to combine the power of numpy with the flexibility of data manipulation and as well as data visualization tools together and this enables you to create insightful data analysis capability and complaining visualization okay okay next slide is actually performance optimization and here actually we'll be going to talk about little bit about optimization so guys I'm just going to take a pause and let me actually remind you something this is only the introduction part whatever I'm just going to uh work through you right now this is just going to give you a little bit uh like hint about numpy and what what are the capabilities maybe some of you already know or maybe some of you are actually uh viewing or hearing this word for the first time so it doesn't matter our actual tutorial will start from the next uh video okay so by taking time to master numpa you will gain actually a deep understanding of its capabilities and this will help you to optimize your code for maximum performance so numpy can help you to actually optimize your code performance right so that is why I'm actually mentioned this two point in this slide so this will not only enhance your productivity but also lay a solid foundation for exploring advanced concepts in data science and machine learning right so numpy is also for performance optimization or code Improvement code you can actually run your code or execution or data uh like or data science like pipeline or the data integration pipeline very fast okay Lex actually uh foundation for advanced concept so basically whether you are data scientist or or if you are a machine learning engineer or simply you are interested in the fascinating uh field of data analytics then this course or this part is actually going to help you to build a solid groundwork for advanced uh data science and ml concept and also just because we are actually going to explore the advance part of the numpy as well so this will also enhance the productivity and insightful exploration within yourself right so let me check uh next we come to the next very important part which is the course outline okay so in the course outline if you see I am actually mentioned here total 10 topics one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve total total 12 topics are there but out of that maybe uh I believe the conclusion part is actually not I'm just going going to talk is not a topic but rather than I can actually help you guys to do or give some idea about some some Project work or maybe uh some Advance or like resources so that you can actually um further more level of your or sharpen your skill right so in the first topic which is Introduction to numpy so in this slide or in the sorry in this uh tutorial I'll be going to talk about what is numpy importance of numpy in data science and machine learning and basic array creation manipulation operation right so next topic is actually our course is actually basic numpy concept so in this concept we'll be going to talk about indexing slicing refaping of arrays and then the next important thing is actually array broadcasting then we'll be going to uh learn about Universal functions and after that we'll be going to do aggregation and reduction operations so everything will be discussed first in little bit of theory and after that we'll be going to do everything with the help of python code and we'll be going to create some hands-on experience right so I'll be going to give you a little bit about the theoretical part or little information about the theoretical part but the maximum thing or maximum Talent spent by writing the code with python okay so it will be uh completely Hands-On course okay so next topic is actually intermediate uh numpy concept so in this in this part we'll be going to do some fancy indexing and Boolean masking which is very important then we'll do structure and record errors okay then we'll be going to do how to read and writing array data and after that we'll be going to do Advanced broadcasting okay so next topic is actually Advanced numpy concept so in this Advanced numpy concept what we'll do we'll be going to start our journey uh with memory layout and array views then we'll be going to do a very detailed uh like operation with a linear algebra how how numpy helps uh actually you to do uh like something with linear algebra here I'll be going to actually start with a very basic example to do some Advanced examples then we'll do Advanced array manipulation techniques and after that we'll be going to multi-dimensional array and they are indexing right so then actually our journey will start with data science so first one two three four five uh tutorial actually uh going to build your uh like like basic uh like Foundation or maybe you can say this five tutorial is the pillar going to work as a pillar okay then you know we'll be going to start working on numpy for data science here we'll be going to start with data manipulation with numpy array exploratory data analysis using numpy array then we'll do a statistical analysis with numpy array and handling missing data with numpy array all these things will be going to do with the help of numpy then we'll start the machine learning okay I can I can do it together but just because sake of Simplicity I'll just create two separate like module okay in the next module we'll be going to do numpy for machine learning here we'll be going to uh learn how to do feature engineering and pre-processing with numpy then again we'll do some Advanced operation with linear algebra in numpy then we'll be going to do PCL which is the principal component analysis with numpy and after that we'll be going to do some linear equation solving uh like capabilities with the help pop numpy okay then another important and interesting and very exciting topic which is also my favorite maybe uh most of you also excited to actually learn this topic which is image processing with numpy so next module is actually numpy for image processing okay I actually missed that part right here yes so basically just hold on so I can actually write this thing here numpy for image processing and Signal processing so basically let me write this thing online image and Signal processing right so let's start the okay so here what we'll do so image processing image representation using numpy array image manipulation with numpy array image filtration with numpy array and calculation and age detection using numpy array all these techniques will be going to learn here using numpy and trust me Guys these are the very very like important operation if you are going to start working on the image processing next comes the signal processing so signal representation with numpy array first Fourier transformation using numpy array and filtering and convolution using numpy URL if you are electrical engineer or if you are working for some Electronics project then also these things are very important guys okay so next topic or next module is actually numpy for optimization so optimization using numpy arrays and function first we'll start with this basic thing and after that we'll be going to uh like uh like sharpen our skill by doing some linear programming and after that we'll be going to do the uh more operation using quadratic programming okay and everything will be Hands-On will be going to use continuous program uh like programming approach using python okay so next topic or next module is actually numpy for time series analytics so time series data manipulation okay we'll start with this topic then we'll be going to uh uh sharpen again our scale using rolling statistics and moving average okay and then time series decomposition okay all these three things are very important if you are a marketing graduate if you want to actually do better in your marketing survey or research or if you are just going to start working on some sales project as a sales engineer or if you are a very working as a very um like a prestigious role in some company sales department then this things are very important the time series analysis is very important for marketing time series if or anyways if you are going to generate some money then definitely time series analysis is actually very much important not only money for any sort of forecasting right so then next topic is actually numpy performance optimization okay so here we'll be going to learn uh vectorization on optimization optimizing code vectorization with the help of that will be going to learn how to optimizing your code these are the advanced topics and then we'll be going to learn some memory management takes tricks tips and clicks and then profiling and benchmarking so all these things are Advanced topic if I give you some hints now it will not going to uh uh help you to understand but I think when actually going to start this module I'll try to do it very slowly so that everybody will understand so these are the few topics which we'll never find in the internet or YouTube any other like playlist this is the first of this is for the first time I'm creating this very detailed tutorial because before creating this tutorial I did lot of research and I find out what other things are missing in other playlists so that I can actually come up with some valuable content so that you guys can get the benefit out of this okay because number is very important thing if you are going to start your journey as a data scientist or machine learning or ultimately if you want to do better in some AI topics right so next thing is actually uh next shootings is actually very basic thing so some best practice guides and tips so I'll going to help you to write Your Efficient code I'll give some error handling and debugging trips and also some uh further Advanced resource for Learning and the last part will be the conclusion so here I'll be going to actually give you a complete recap or overview of what exactly we learned what are the things you can do as a project that also give you some idea and after that maybe I'll also share you some insights about some jobs like where actually you can apply with your limited numpy scale like who I am say limited numpy skills course after number you have to also learn math plotly pandas library right and also you have to be very good in object oriented programming so that is something uh limited like skill but again I'll try to help you to give some insight about some jobs and some requirements so that you can actually at least try your luck okay and last but not least we are not going to start software my target is actually to finish this tutorial in next one month and after that I'm planning to actually start a new series on pandas and after that we'll be going to start a new series on matplotlip so all prerequisite whatever is required for data science or machine learning will be covered right okay so guys uh
