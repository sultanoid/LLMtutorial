sorry I'm sharting the wrong window still I'm sharing the wrong window all right okay so um welcome to the session on uh geni so generative AI is been the buzzword in the industry off late we are hearing very often that uh generate the kind of Revolution that generative AI is bringing into picture so uh we'll have a quick introduction of how this concept of AI started and where um the application of AI will actually help us in terms of effective delivery of projects and where it can really make the project managers life easy um when it when it uh comes to managing the um the projects and delivery of the projects not only that but uh the buzz question in the in the in the industry that speaks about uh um Can AI replace us is the project manager for that matter so we will try to get an answer towards the end of the session we'll try to have a discussion around it we will have our views shared and um today for this webinar it is kind of structured like we I will give you a quick overview of how this AI is evolved and what are the different areas of application because AI the word AI is something which is uh widely used in today's world and we actually without knowing that we are uh specifically speaking about AI or using AI we actually use it in day-to-day activities but uh intentionally making the best use of it and leveraging the capability to make our life easy in terms of project management is something what our primary focus is all right so coming to the quick background so AI uh the roots of AI lays back to 1940s where the original uh neural networks have been uh started during the World War uh World War II that is when um that touring machines have uh come out to decode the the code language that has been sent by the other other nations so uh Germans predominantly started using that uh so the foundation lays back uh many decades before so it's 1940s onwards it is there as it started evolving if you see the the road map the world's first chatbot has uh come into picture existence in 1960s itself so we use chatbots on every website today but the foundation for that has laid sometime in 1960s almost five decades five to six decades before then um the predominantly the the word AI um came into a picture in uh '90s and 2000s somewhere around that so that is where uh uh the big buzz is created around the the Chess World Champion has been defeated by uh the ibms Waton so that is a the artificial intelligence program that they spoke about and uh in fact uh over a period of time it started evolving so Watson when it first competed with the the chess champion it actually lost so he the CH the chess champion won uh the Russian Champion I'm speaking about and uh over a period of time when IBM took it back and then it started uh revising the machines and um upgrading the machines then that is when it actually could defeat um the the CH Champion as well now uh if you look at this that has been a trend so artificial intelligence machines what we are using the applications that we are using they are not up to the mark they're not accurate but they keep learning as we move forward so uh then came uh the another machine where uh the Go game in China Chinese go game which is much more complex and much more probability probabilities are there uh that is uh the place where the actual neural networks have come into picture so if you look at Watson so it predominantly works on the if condition you know what if this move happens what are the probabilities and based on that it kinds of comes back but uh when it comes to uh go it has many millions of combinations where the move can happen so that is when uh the processing power of uh the machines come into picture and every move it started learning on its own and then it started storing inside the neurons like how we store in the brain so uh artificial neurons are created in terms of a neural network and it started storing the data from which it learns and starts predicting the moves it starts generating the new moves so that is where the foundation for generative AI comes into picture so artificial intelligence is the broader umbrella in which we have multiple um applications of artificial intelligence so if you categorize them broadly into traditional Ai and generative AI so generative AI predominantly comes into picture when it can actually generate the content so the content can be a new move a new strategy a new uh suggestion based on the data a new insights that it can provide to US based on the data now we all use chat GPT often um um the completely the natural language processing so it can understand the way you speak and then it can resp respond to it and accuracy wise it's pretty high even though it is not 100% accurate which takes a lot of time and a lot of data for that to keep learning but reasonably good uh accuracy has been achieved in in today's world so traditional AI predominantly speak uh focuses on problem solving speech recognition uh we all use the transcripts and uh uh the translations that we speak about so those things and decision making uh giving the insights and it takes so this part predominantly focus on uh traditional uh uh traditional artificial intelligence whereas uh generative AI can generate more data and which human brain cannot think it with this computing power it can generate additional things and then keep giving us so uh we um there are multiple applications to it like starting from uh uh from uh now you see my virtual background here so it recognizes me Cuts me off cuts my background round off and replace it with something else so this is also one one application of artificial intelligence it it recognizes the person so start starting from this we all use YouTube we all use Netflix so the how are how is YouTube predicting the or suggesting you the right videos based on what you watch based on what your preferences are uh it keeps learning on its own that these might be of interest to him and from the millions and billions of videos and content that is available on the platform it suggests you the right one which is more applicable for you so from there up until uh using a a computer vision like uh application where uh uh automated cars self-driving cars which Tesla is uh kind of testing Google is kind of testing where it processes millions of images per second and then it reads whether the how the roads are going how the traffic is on the road any obstacles are there so from the simple applications to a very complex applications like computer vision so every industry started adapting these things so if you if you see some of the applications are like Art and Design music composition video creation image Creations you know uh product designs for financial forecastings this is also widely used uh health and diagnosis Healthcare so these are all different different industries that actually have started using uh the AI applications now coming to uh if we have to categorize the modern AI predominantly uh you can have these four things where we say that uh generative AI where it creates the new content based on the learning patterns and the data need not be labeled so anything that you speak it can start generating based on that then the the machine learning where um a structured data um should be there with um some labels around it and from that it starts learning and then it will give us pred itions something like dish entries uh you know uh all the recommendations that we speak about so those things uh are part of machine learning part and deep learning which is predominantly built on the neural networks that is a kind of a subset or an advanced subset of machine learning so where uh you create multiple neurons like how our brain consists of neurons and we store the um the information there so deep learning does the same thing in multiple artificial neurons that are created in a software application where uh it keeps on uh storing this information in different nodes and all these nodes are interconnected so they make the relationships and make the patterns out of it so all that uh U recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks whatever we spoke we speak about all these Transformers that we speaking about all these chat GPT everything is built on the Deep learning modules so llms is Lar language models predominantly one variant of the deep learning algorithms that are being used where uh we all use the GPT that is generative pre-train Transformer so that is also one of the very powerful um deep learning algorithm that has been created in the world now what can AI actually do to us like when application in the project management predominantly if you look at it simple things like automating the routine tasks like if you want to create a status report so why do we have to spend so much of time uh instead of it we can simply go and and speak to a system where it can understand and brings the data from a source uh and analyze the data and transforms it into a meaningful report so that is something what many of our project managers in the project management Community we spend a lot of time in it but that can be automated assisting in complex analysis so what if this task goes delay what if this vendor doesn't delay the material on time what is the impact on the overall project what is what might go wrong with the budget so what are the impacts of political situations on my project so these kind of complex analysis where a lot of ifs and buts are there and no structured or robust data is available so this is where uh AI can uh bring in its comput computing power to process so much of data in a short time and give you and databased you know uh information or databased analysis probably you can say an insight into the into the thing that is happening there in the project then augmenting the human efforts excuse me so suggesting solutions to the to the problems that you have what are the probability solutions that can uh we brought in for a for an issue what can be an alternate plan correction plan plans correction things all these things uh you can use that now um in complex analysis especially when we speak about uh the complex analysis that is where uh humanly doing certain tasks will be practically almost impossible so that is where we can leverage that capacity of this uh artificial intelligence system especially gen generative AI systems and then we can go and do some of these uh these things that are there like resource allocation so we struggle with a lot of tools even though such a sophistication around project management tools are available still uh there's a lot of struggle across the globe when it comes to handling resources especially when the resources are working in a cross functional environment and in a in a in a matrix kind of organization where resources are deployed on multiple projects and uh the utilization of the resources needs to be managed in multiple scenarios multiple projects so that is uh one area where we can leverage the capability of artificial intelligence systems then risk management in terms of identifying or uh procrastinating what can go wrong in the Project based on excuse me based on the historical information and what is happening the change management assessing the impact of the scope or impact impact of the change on multiple objectives of the project so any objective how it can get affected or if one particular change can impact multiple objectives together so then how do we analyze that together so these kind of things um we doing it using a tool manually might be challenging in large projects so that is where we can take the capability of uh generative AI so stakeholder management um again communication stakeholder engagement so uh engaging the stakeholders throughout the project has been uh of atmost importance in project management which can um actually add a lot of value to the project then uh Project prioritization based on certain par like the for example if you take what is the budget that is being uh allocated to the project and what is the benefit that we are reaping out of it so these kind of things also uh you can you can go and take decisions based on whenever that complex dat uh data intensive decisions are taken and we have huge amount of data to process humanly that may not be possible to process so much of data can use G generative AI so till now if you look at our discussion we have always speaking about how do we use it but for for adopting Ai and making it use do we AI is completely built on statistics math coding and solving problems so this is what uh AI generative AI uh can do for us but do we really need to learn statistics maths coding the answer is no so so then what do we do then how do we do it so it's one simple the machines are already created thanks to the coming community of a lot of Engineers St statisticians mathematicians who have come together to create the Deep learning models that we have today so strong and robust models and also uh the computational power in terms of Hardware that is available in today's world where it can deploy these kind of large models and uh and utilize it effectively all that we need to do is utilize them effectively so how do we utilize them so one way to through which we do it is predominantly using prompt engineering so what is a prompt prompt is um a uh a sentence or an adjective or uh the way in which you communicate with an artificial intelligence system so if you look at it you need to Define I mean systems are systems and they they the they can understand certain things in a certain fashion so uh you need to go and phrase the sentences or build the queries in an effective way where the system can actually um understand it get the data that you want it and give you the meaningful information so anybody can use AI anybody can give the prompts but the results that are coming out of it in order to uh reduce the the vulnerability of the the results so that is where the prompt engineering learning it properly and utilizing it properly will actually bring in a lot of value so that is where the prompt engineering actually uh comes into picture so effectively utilizing the generative AI engines that are there the Transformers that are there is how well it understands the prompts given to it and how uh accurately it gives us the result that we wanted so if you want a result with with higher accuracy levels and and it gives us more meaningful uh output then the prompts also should be meaningful but meaningful not from our sense but from the sense of the the Transformer that we are using so what we will do now we will take uh the Enterprise risk management as our subject today so we will see in terms of project delivery in our series of AI webinars in the last series we have done uh um how do we develop a project plan a project schedule and then use project management software like Microsoft Project to effectively build a proper plan in in almost negligible time you know in in less than 10 to 15 minutes we have come out with a beautiful plan using uh chat GPT as the engine so now as an extension to it for the benefit of uh few of us who have joined us for the first time I'll quickly take you through how uh to build a proper schedule using Genera AI or using chat GPT and how did we do that um in the last session I'll take five minutes to give you a brief of it and then as an extension to it so we will today we are going to focus on the risk management part where uh how how do we leverage the capability of chat GPT to identify the risks in our project also uh to start with how do we um use chat GPT to establish a risk management practice in our organization then apply this risk management framework into uh a a project using a simple project so risk management uh scope varies from a simple task will have a risk a projects will have a risk your programs will have a risk and Enterprise level there are risks so it's a vast area so we will see in different layers how do we actually go and utilize chat GPT to apply the risk management practices across the organization so I'll invite sin sir to take us through a live demo on the CH GPT uh using chat GPT how do we establish the Enterprise risk management practice to begin with and then uh we will take it up into uh implementing that practice using one simple project yeah sir over to you thank you uh thank you Prashant uh for walking through the fundamentals and uh uh how we can take it into practice practice and uh all the audience uh thanks for subscribing and uh uh we are still learning uh some of you here may be much more advanced some of you may be uh uh here for the first time so since we have not done much of audience analysis okay please uh if we are preliminary take it if you are Advanced ask ask for any clarifications we are free to to answer uh so what I'll do is uh uh I will uh See since we are doing Management training management consulting uh that is our Focus area and uh we are passionate about it and uh how this uh can basically simplify some of uh our efforts I remember uh way back in uh uh 1990s when we implemented ISO 9000 for my company uh it took more than a year to establish a quality management system cutting across 67 departments later during uh somewhere around 2 uh 3 2005 uh when I was program manager for cmmi implementation uh it took again about 15 months to establish uh uh the system and Performing the the audit and then get uh ourselves accreditated so we thought uh we'll take uh a simple use case uh in terms of uh how do we move an organization into a Enterprise risk management practice now being an rmp uh I know the methodologies and also uh we came across our own clients uh who basically for months together or even more than a year struggling to establish uh a good risk management uh framework practice and then change management and adoption but on the other hand it is so critical now organization comes from a topown view everything Mo revolves around risks and opportunities how do we strategize how do we take initiatives Etc all right so this is the background and how when we put in the brocher how we can achieve probably a 10x uh acceleration in terms of uh a roll out of such uh complex uh uh change oriented concept so what you see on the screen uh is basically uh an Enterprise app developed by our Prov team uh as a a vehicle to transform a company in terms of ERM Journey so in any of the you can basically scale it to any other management methodologies but if you look at it on the left side uh we have basically three four layers okay governance roles and responsibilities is one layer risk governance that needs to be established and then the next tier is uh methodology that comprises of uh uh processes the workflow and then approvals and other stuff and uh then you have a separate uh category called tools and techniques uh from an operational strategy perspective organization should constantly uh introspect from an internal perspective and from a external environment perspective so we have used three key analysis pestal analysis for Enterprise uh external factors and 7s meany 7s analysis for internal factors and then swap for every uh need to uh bring out these kind of risks and opportunities at various levels and then finally in terms of decision making and then viewing how they are doing there is a uh dashboard and reports so this is the broad level uh what I'll do now is uh I'll turn to uh uh this one chat GPT uh where uh we will basically uh look at uh uh one second I'll just uh take uh yeah so uh instead of taking lot of time to do some typing and other stuff uh I will basically uh minimize uh uh to get one few scripts that were written before that just give me a moment so are you searching for any of the existing things that you have done yeah I I I I just reenable this give me one second okay okay yeah can you refresh the page once okay am I audible oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah quite AUD sir uh can you refresh the page it will be there yeah mym page yes sir no it's agib browser browser tab you can have it yeah okay yeah I think one is you I should uh move up now yes sir yeah yeah I got it okay yeah so uh what I'll do is uh I'll just take one uh use case uh where okay the first layer okay in terms of uh uh risk governance okay I'll take oil and gas industry as a use case and uh I'll ask the system prescribes a governance framework for an organization uh that comprises of uh uh one second okay prescribe your risk governance framework okay with uh with the policy principles and uh uh objectives for and oil and gas industry uh to establish and ERM practice okay now every time I search things will be different but let's just look at uh okay what it gives so you see here uh maybe within 30 seconds okay you get uh what should be the risk policy for an island gas industry and then what are the core principles alignment with organization strategic objectives it should be a proactive preventive approach it should be holistic and integrated it should focus on compliance accountability how stakeholder engagement and continuous Improvement and uh what are the core objectives of Enterprise risk management and uh what should be the framework components in terms of the roles responsibilities and the proc processes Etc and the implementation guidelines uh I understand just to arrive at this okay it takes probably 3 to four weeks okay with multiple meetings but now even now those meetings will be there but we will have a a strong background information with which we can just go and walk through with a customer and uh tailor to that specific industry and it will have a a policy with properly framed and other things now having done that I'll come back to my system and then once it is agreed with the people and key stakeholders come back here what should be the risk governance so here if you look at it uh so it has a risk policy it has a risk set of objectives and principles and then what are the core principles and the other related items okay so I can basically document it get it approved baselined it and then I move on to the core roles and responsibilities so I in the first prompt itself I can do that or I can go and refine it tell me what are the core roles in terms of Chief risk officer risk champion risk owner risk action owner individual Department spars and the role of project manager program manager operation head head of the department when it comes to risk management practice what I found is almost 80% accurate it gives you very clearly I need to take it uh align it to the specific people come back here and uh create uh the respective roles and responsibilities so who is going to take a specific role and then what is the role so Ro here risk sponsor risk Champion risk Department spoke location spoke risk owner action owner HD project manager program manager so I create a uh risk oriented organization structure for ERM so what is important is try to give a foundational uh document and then brainstorm it with specific owners one one meeting with potential roles responsibilities Cup come back and build the uh Arc structure Define the roles and responsibilities get it agreed Baseline them and then I move on to risk methodology okay so risk methodology I guess all of you here who all uh know very well okay I have looked at at least four five the international standards and methodologies more or less everything speaks about the same cycle okay a strategy uh and uh risk identification risk assessment risk response planning risk monitoring and control okay when it comes to erm we need to understand that strategy portfolio operation that doesn't end so we need to realign it how we need to do this quarter after quarter when it comes to project project Centric when it comes to program program Centric and then build this uh methodology so if uh for the first time we can put another one prompt okay suggest me a methodology and a workflow and what are the key attributes for each of the stage and this has been done and you see that uh a very robust uh methodology is brought in so now I'll ask Prashant to uh for the same oil and gas industry use case quickly build a risk register probably with the top 10 or 15 risks and then give a a potential analysis response plan and uh we can take it as a starting point to do the management workshop with the key stakeholders okay prant will you use the same oil and gas industry and then build a quickly build a risk register I'll do that sir but uh before that I'll quickly uh give a quick recap on uh um what we done as a part of our first first first uh we'll give it at the end yeah we'll do that it is actually built together okay okay yeah yeah let let me take it that way so I'll go and I'll share my screen I can see my screen right all right so I'll pull up um a chat GPT chat GPT window and I'll open a new chat now um what I'm trying to do is first uh uh we will I mean in terms of project delivery so how do we kind of take this uh build up first we need to uh make the the system understand what project is about so instead of me going and telling the system that this is a project what I'm trying to do I'll first uh quickly give you what we have done in our last uh uh session of the webinar where we built a proper project schedule and then we used it to uh export it into uh uh project management information system and then we we tried building a pro project plan there there so for that what I'll do is I'll uh go and quickly say that U build a project plan uh in a tabular format um to uh which which project do we take in oil and gas industry so like uh shall we say that an extension of a plant extension of a Refinery or something yeah can you hear me yeah yeah extension of um existing facility of oil refinery with uh let's say five phases and activities of each phase and each activity should have the durations and predecessors so that the entire network and the schedule will be built so I'll go and give this as my first prompt where you can see the chat GPT goes and works now this is a paid version of chat GPT and uh we are using the latest uh model 4.40 for uh this thing so 40 predominantly speaks about uh most of the generic tasks it'll do good but you can also have that o1 where you can have much much more analytical and reasoning capability models also but this is more relatively more stable and that is inst still in the uh testing phase so I just brought that uh into it now if you look at it there are five phases that are prepared planning and design site preparation construction of the extension of the uh existing plan testing and commissioning and Handover now if you further want to refine it you can give additional prompts I'll just use one prompt uh where I will say merge um The Phases with activities um and uh show The Phases as summary tasks so uh you can keep on revising and refining this plan uh refining the the table what we have generated the plan what we have generated now if you look at it the phase one is uh planning and design 1.1 1.2 the respective activities with the respective durations and you have predecessors and uh the expansion or a description of the tasks also in the remarks column so this is the uh the plan that we have built which you can simply go and say that uh export this plan into an Excel sheet and uh this is a paid uh functionality of chat GPT where it can read the data from the files and also put the data into files so free version doesn't have this yeah Mr Gokul are you trying to speak something 12:30 I'll share 11:3 just mute okay I'm just muting him so now if you look at it it's analyzing and then it will create uh the Excel sheet so that Excel sheet you directly import download it onto your desktop you just click on the link and it can download the file and uh with with few clicks of a button so you can just point to this Excel sheet and Microsoft Project can build a beautiful project plan so that is what we have done in our previous webinar not going to do it again so we have the recordings available on our YouTube Channel please uh visit the YouTube channel and we also share the link uh to all of you for the YouTube channel and the previous webinar along with the presentation deck what we have used so you can uh visit the YouTube channel to go and look at how do we build a proper schedule using Microsoft Project from the project plan that we have taken at so now what I'll do is um uh I will say that for this particular project whatever we have built already the project plan is the beauty of any Transformers are using it for the first time the beauty of it is it is a conversation remember that you're are having a conversation with the Transformer so whatever the the results that have come up in the in the previous chats and whatever the proms that you are trying to give uh previously so everything it keeps a track as long as you are inside the same chat it keeps a continuation of the conversation so again when you're going and now I'm going to go and ask ask chat GPT to build some 20 risks Identify some 20 risks but now I'm not going to go and explain what the project is and and this Pro for this project you go and bring bring the 20 risk no you just identify 20 risk for this project and it'll take consider the previous uh data whatever is there and it considers that project and identifies the risk so let us go and build a risk register for it let's say I'll identify um 20 risks for this project like as I said with the additional information like uh the likelihood likelihood is the probability and the impact for both pre mitigation and post mitigation uh likelihood and impact so that it'll calculate the score so that it'll be easy for us to analyze and prioritize the risks uh which are top priority risk what are low priority risk which you can keep it in the watch list so that part you can do it and uh also along with that um you uh prepare a response response strategy and the response action and all of this together you give it in a table format so this is important because uh this is a llm large language model if you don't mention in which format you need it it'll start giving you in the form of a text description so if it is in table format it is easy for us to go and use any applications like ERM what you have seen the power ERM that we spoke about you can just directly go and bring it into it so that is how it works now if you start looking at it um it's it starts with risk ID description of the risk the risk name uh likelihood impact um pre pre mitigation post mitigation then the response strategy and uh the response action also now um likelihood and the pre and post mitigation scores are Mr go Mr Gokul are you trying to speak to us okay so I'm unable to mute him also okay all right okay so now you can see the the risk name uh the impacts and all so all are there so now one thing what I um what what we have to do is we have to kind of tame this risk register to be in alignment with the system that we're using now if you see likelihood impact and all high medium low is the scale that they've used it but I cannot uh import the same structure into my tool so what my tool uh mym tool is predominantly designed in such a way that it assesses the impact in terms of uh uh numbers 1 to five on a scale of 1 to five so what I'll do is uh give the likelyhood and impact on a scale of 1 to 5 and uh Cal and also give the risk score now if I say this what happens so now it starts building it now you can see there is uh um the score being Rewritten in form of uh the numbers and also there is the score that is being calculated and added now further if you want to go and further take one more step you can also add the risk categorization whether it's risk is not always about something that is going bad it's not always about the threats you can also identify the opportunities and bring those opportunities into picture so uh if if you want to do that I can prepare the the next prompt uh in in the meantime um I'll say add uh one more column by name um by name uh risk type and the value um yeah the value as threat or opportunity and um uh along with that yeah along with that what I'll do is I'll rename the columns rename the pre and post what are there in the brackets I don't want them to be uh like pre and post in in the brackets but I want them to be kind of uh uh pre mitigation F fully written as pre mitigation and post po mitigation for both likelyhood and impact sorry mation likelihood and post mitigation likelihood for both impact columns also so now when I do that uh now it adds one additional type risk type now you can see there's a new after the description there's a risk type which is threat and now you can see Prem mitigation likelihood post mitigation all the columns are renamed so I'm trying to bring this uh table what chat jpt has given us to a very prompt match to my template what I'm going to import into my power ERM so that's what I'm trying to do so you can see there are list of all the threats that are there but uh um a replay uh five threats I mean I can add it but I'm just I just wanted that be 20 uh with potential opportunities and uh you can see some of the threats in the system will become uh will be replaced as opportunities so that is a same table it keeps updating updating and all so once that is done what I'll do is I have a template available where uh I'll just bring that up so this is the template that I'm speaking about which has been exported from my power ERM system so these are all the columns that are there so I tried matching all the columns to these columns that we have here in the template so I'll do one uh one thing I'll just directly go and say that the table is good but with which format will you give it to me so if you see the how beautifully it can think when you actually promptly give it so if it is a threat the score pre-mitigation score is 25 post mitigation score is nine So based on the response the score is reduced but for the same thing if it's an opportunity the score is 12 Prem mitigation and you're enhancing the opportunity the score increased to 20 so it should work in the reverse way and that will be taken care by the system we don't need to worry about it now what I'll do is I want this uh risk register what CH GPT has built to be brought in into my uh template so what I'll do is I'll go and upload my upload this template risk register template and then I will say that you place all these 20 risks in the template attached without changing the table and it headers because the template should not be disturbed for me because I want this data to be written inside the template so that is what I wanted it to be done so now all these 20 risks whatever we have we have built so that will be uh will be placed inside this template beautifully aligned to to the each of these columns and if there is any mismatch it has the capability to go and match the columns and place it even though there are slight variations here and there it can St do it but in case if it is not there you can go and write one more prompt saying that you update the table to the column name to be this so there are some columns which should not be modified by the chat GPT so like you can see there is something called do not modify uh inside the Excel template which this uh Power ERM requires that so I told the system not to go and change the column headers without changing the table and its headers you try to place these 20 risks as uh what we are trying to put that there so it takes a bit of while because it is building a file so if you want to see the process what is happening you can see all the columns and it's mapping how it's mapping and all it's happening at the at the granular level so everything is built on python uh scripting so you can see those and once this is ready uh an Excel sheet uh will be ready with the risk register that has been built now we just click on this and it will download that file and if I go and open it you can see all the risks that are uh that have been identified are beautifully placed inside this Excel sheet so risk IDs with risk names types everything is is beautifully placed inside this so now this Excel sheet whatever I have I will share it with uh with Sam so that he can go and take that uh into ERM and upload it into ERM and see with one few click of button all the 20 risks and the opportunities that we have identified it'll be beautifully populated there over to you Sam yes sir is my screen visible to all of you yes sir all the best yeah so now that we enter into the uh Power ERM uh the solution especially inside the risk methodology so these are all the pre-existing risks now I will go and import that Excel what I received what I have downloaded just now I can there is a feature to import that Excel so I choose the file I'll go to my desktop and then click on the Excel and it takes as Prashant was telling it takes very few clicks to um uh bring all the risks from the Excel I'll click next and then I say before I just finish the import I'll just review my mapping so as he said there are some of the things which will not be mapped from ERM so from chart GPT so which I will map them manually but other things are good I'll finish my import and I'll confirm it and data has been submitted okay so I click on the track progress I would get some progress here uh what is happening in the back end and then I will go and click on done and then uh if I just click one refresh all these ID numbers 1 to 20 uh would come here so whatever is generated right now these are all uh okay so the latest 1 to 20 are the risks uh that has been copied from Excel sheet to the power ERM now I'll take you to uh one of these um the risk if I click open and uh workflow predetermined workflow has been there so we are in the ideation Okay so followed by assessment uh response planning monitoring we'll see stage by stage so this is the data prepopulated already from the Excel and I would need to give the um uh the owner of this risk okay and uh the manager of this risk since these are all uh these two are the mandatory Fields I'll click on save from the top and then I'll take to the next stage so other things are there so I'll click on the next stage this will take me to the assessment so specially in this so the pre mitigation even here okay so we have brought the data from Excel so you don't need to do anything so this is there and then I'll click assessment and click on the next stage this will now take me to uh response planning the same what he has created so you'll see the response uh action as well okay uh the other things other data has been populated okay and and we can also see the post M mitigation from the Excel data ideally we need to create here and then manually do every cell so now that uh from the Excel it has been pre-populated then what I'll do I'll take this to monitoring I click and then click on the next stage okay so this will take me to monitoring and you'll see the new uh additional tabs that are added which is a risk report this is what uh um uh the final stage for for us so we can realize uh that as a as part I mean like this as a heat map uh the risk status you'll see the name of the risk and then the uh mitigation category pre-mitigation now that it has become low part of Po post mitigation and it is still open and you can see the the report like this all right um that's a simple flow uh for the risk from the identification till you monitor the risk uh now that I'll give it to senen Sir would you like to add anything to it yeah uh fine so you want me to continue yes sir okay okay yeah one second can you see the screen sir yeah I I can see your screen yeah Zoom now but teams no yes yeah are you sharing it or want me to share the I'm sharing it okay okay uh let me go here I'll open what Sam completed we have seen the methodology part and uh as I told you the Enterprise risk management looks from strategy uh operations projects portfolio programs and operations so when it comes to operations uh uh some of the risk will occur so we need to watch the uh the trend how frequently it is coming so that part needs to be recorded and uh as part of uh monitoring uh we also need to continually improve in terms of uh uh the Improvement suggestions comes from audit so the here we can basically uh generate a checklist for a specific Department audit or a specific uh audit and then with that uh uh we can basically go and uh upload a checklist and then audit once the audit is done reports are given and you need to act on it so there will be a action report okay in terms of closing the non-conformities and other other things should be timely done so these are the things uh that goes as part of uh methodology and then actual okay doing it and improving it on a continuous basis and then I also talked about some of the tools and techniques currently uh we have automated three techniques which are most important uh one is uh external through pestel analysis and then uh internal organization factors through 7s analysis I'll just show you one part pestil alone uh so the pestil you all know is the acronym of uh political economical social technological legal and environmental so this is something we need to do it uh on a event driven or on a routine basis so how this is done uh let me look at it now for this again for example to this particular industry okay so what kind of uh this uh pesle factors can influence we can create a checklist against that checklist you can compare it for your own organization where do we stand so let me uh go through one or two for example when it comes to political uh so let's say I'll edit so you'll see here uh these are the political of factors okay how the government policy is okay the policy then is it highly favorable favorable neutral or unfavorable highly unfavorable now based on this basically a score will be generated okay for each of this factor and then uh uh so you can save it and then you can go on uh multiple iterations through various factors internal factors and external factors and then uh finally okay basically in the details page you will see that uh political score economic score social score technological score okay so this is the the total uh weightage of the pestal analysis will be worked out through each of these tabs the same is the case with 7s uh so you can go and do it in terms of uh organization strategy structure systems Shar values style of the leadership and management staff in terms of capability and other stuffs so we can do it and see what is the overall strength of the organization now having done all these things in every area if you look at it uh for example in a pestal analysis if I pick up uh a specific analysis and then go to a specific Factor where okay so let's I'll go here finally it can trigger an opportunity or threat or even an initiative okay so you can go and okay if you see that the current government change is uh not so good for this specific industry there is a threat now that from here we can move it to our risk Master risk register and then go and put the action what we need to do okay in the uh near term okay what are the action plan and need to be timely closed so in any of these analysis for all the identified factors you can segment which of them are threats which of them are opportunities and then what should be the response strategy and all and of course one of the important aspect is the government's oversight so where okay we can go and periodical analysis at the function level unit level overall corporate level so we can go and look through it so overall risk governance and then risk dashboard uh so that will basically give the uh the master list at the Enterprise level and uh other various uh indicators uh in terms of uh what is the total count what are the statuses in which category and then the the detailed analysis in terms of both visual as well as objective who owns it how many of them are closed so this can be segmented at the business unit level and uh it can be segmented at the location level department level project level program level So This Could Be One Stop Shop where everyone can do their own respective analysis and then uh what are the audits that were taken place is what are the action plog how they are being brought to closure and what is the pestal analysis Uh current analysis what are the past analysis score which of them are red which of them are green favorable and so so you can see how those things can be okay managed in terms of sess where are we strong which of them area are import are needs improvement from there what is the action okay and then bring it to respective risk or uh opportunity category for a timely closure so now for all of them again as we Prashant played in terms of an use case so we can always seek what is the global best practices and currently we are also working uh what we have seen is finding out from the external Source Global best practices and then bring it into the organization so the next step what we are working on is looking at our own organization's internal information from there how do we analyze and bring out okay the analysis for the ERM practice so that PO is also going on uh then we will basically do in two iterations okay isolate internal and do external and bring it inside and then isolate external do it for internal statistics so that you don't leave the proprietory information go out of your organization so those are the things standard products are available like uh co-pilot and very various other models but sometimes they may not really go such deep okay when it comes to Specific Enterprise practice so we are working on our own uh kind of uh tooling so that will work within the tool okay within this uh portal to do those analysis specific to the industry so that's a bit of demo I don't want to stretch too long and uh a lot of people are here project management community and also smmes in uh uh risk management ERM so uh this is an experiment learning so we would like like to hear from you okay your uh feedback uh and which areas that we should focus on improve and if you find any specific activity to be done within your organization we can always come and help you okay in terms of uh knowledge transfer or in terms of some specific work to be done to establish uh either pmo practice or ERM practice uh or any other thing within your industry in fact what I have shown last time what we have shown this time it could be very common to any kind of management uh framework methodology roll out within the organization so all we need to do it is uh extend it to the specific standards and methodologies so which uh as process experts will be able to guide you to do that so I will leave this here uh for a a time of Q&A so that uh uh I can navigate uh in case if you want to see something within the application or in terms of prompt engineering uh please ask your questions and we'll be happy to answer yeah over to the audience people can unmute and speak yeah so probably I I will I will call out some known names and then uh others can join so I think uh Madame manid Deepa is one of our longtime uh Ambassador for provines madam what do you see Madam so um so this this has been helpful uh and I know having been in the project management field for 10 years plus uh almost 12 years now lot of Rapid developments are happening what I would uh what I would really like to see is you know the resource management aspect of of project management and I think a lot of AI can be leveraged to manage that right now it's a lot of you know data maintenance and trying especially the estimation aspects and the monitoring aspect because one is you have an estimate you never really know what the final monitoring is coming out to be so those are some of the challenges that I see is is an area that AI can hopefully address for us okay okay thank you thank you for the feedback probably the next use case we look at resource optimization part and of course as you said estimation is another a big black box for most of the companies yeah yes thank you thank you thank you especially what I now that I've moved into larger companies allocations and monitoring when you're working in a global environment uh and have to sync calendars and you know find when that person is available Etc these are some of these routine things uh that I find very challenging in terms of estimation and actual monitoring right so so that's that's where I feel that we are probably underutilizing uh resources or you know those kind of challenges or we are overestimating something on the other right so it's very difficult to gauge that so yeah that's something that I see as a challenge estimation in general thank you yeah anybody else uh Lan you were able to join thank you yeah I'm sorry I was late a bit so just thank you you're able to hear me right yes very much yeah so you worked on lot of cyber security and uh other uh uh flavors of uh risk management so what do you see uh how this interaction with uh uh gen and the uh application in terms of roll out and uh uh user adoption uh what do you see M yeah I think I missed you know the larger part of it since I joined late I mean it's incredibly useful thing which to do in fact in case of yam I mean this is really really good I sorry I'll also see how in my particular areas like cyber security or Information Security Management how this can be adopted this is a good Insight I got received today I was never thinking of you know similar applications it's wonderful wonderfully done and thank you it's very good uh in my opinion so information security being a very very vast domain I mean it's uh daily something new comes up so risk management especially it's very very challeng ing uh thing and you know uh in information security probably I will also explore how we can best you know um apply this principles into it yeah thank you sir thank you very much yeah yeah other questions a lot of people have joined say SATA so one one question I have is so uh is it uh generating uh you give the project details are you using because I missed the initial part so are you are you using a to even identify and identify the risk keyword or yeah okay yeah yeah so two ways we can do uh what he gave initially is uh for example he first generated the plan and then against the plan he's asking uh J to expose the vulnerabilities and then potential risks and the uh in terms of magnitude okay likelihood and impact so do that or in general you can give he this is the type of industry and uh so what could be the yeah yeah so we can be more specific genri as well okay thank you yeah I have seen from lnt mesh Gandhi uh how do you see from your perspective yeah you are from infrastructure mesh any others uh one more question uh yeah we have copyight right Microsoft copyight why CH any specific reason for that I mean just to just you know it occurred to me that's the reason I was asking okay Prashant will you be able to take this question no maybe there is some specific reason that's the reason I'm asking I just wanted to know hello uh yes sir yeah uh uh copilot uh see actually copilot is built on chat GPT so copilot predominantly they integrated it into M365 Suite so that it can uh do lot of work around uh your one drive so it can get into documents of your one drive which can be kind of more secured uh version of chat GP you cannot kind of directly go and put that uh your secured uh sensitive information into shat GPT right so with co-pilot it is very much limited to your tenant and to your organization so adaption of chart GPT to an Enterprise is probably you can call it a scil yeah yeah okay okay thanks nice yeah yeah good even yes yeah go ahead I think okay let somebody complete then I'll come back yeah carry on go ahead uh Satya Mr sya yeah okay I think uh thank you for your invitation and really Ator could have learned lot of things with all your approach just let me understand see when you address a risk when you address the risk risk has to be rooted out risk has to be rooted out with a concept called cause treating the res Source treating the source source of cost how this is addressed R okay so the yeah now see let be complete on its own or it is based on the industry experience industry situation or situation okay cannot cannot predict these the the current situation of my industry yeah events events collected and maybe interpred or maybe dynamically advancing get otherwise is it be a real story yeah good question but I think as Prashant started in the beginning no it can never replace uh uh human intelligence and uh it only picks up a vast amount of data from there it uh contextually analyzes and then answers your queries so we need to basic Bally prescribe the uh the various uh uh parameters around that and we'll get the solution and again the solution what we get in terms of root causes okay the means to address the root causes we can do it but it's only I would say an input for our team brainstorming okay you get an input uh put it before the team okay in our context is it relevant or irrelevant if it is relevant how do we make it more relevant and what should be the real action plan that are agreed by us so it only gives you okay something to begin with but that something to begin with instead of uh zero it gives you somewhere around 40 to 60% and then and then take it to 80% is our jobs I believe Saia okay my second question to you like you you been mentioning about the framework what is the criteria of this framework is it is it based on the industry requirement or use any International Frameworks I think the framework what we have adapted is ISO 31,000 and Koso and also from a project program perspective it aligns well with Microsoft sorry U PMI uh risk management uh uh practice standard okay so having said that okay to what extent it Maps it is basically subject to analysis and tailoring because every industry wants their own unique adapted methodology so what you see is uh I would say broadly it uh aligns I checked it okay but specific practices for example risk categorization on what basis you would like to categorize the risk Source based uh uh impact based or function based or project WBS based so the company will have its own way of prescribing categories but again those things can be simply plugged in okay you can just add a new category and then uh put up the lookup list and then add it to the system so it's quite uh I would say like for example we had one uh application deployed not ERM but the other one promise pmo Tool uh the customer asked us can you deploy it in one week and we should start using it okay so we were able to do it not just uh vanilla but also taking their input tailoring it and then deploying it in six working days we could do that Satya congratulations only my S would be like you have you the PID Char and if you can add one column about the risk then one is event other is the what you call what actually the event the chart GP is predicted or what causes the chart GP is also predicting and St my end relevant to me or not then I can customize and I request you look into this yeah yeah all right okay yeah Jes you had a question and one second Jo J has asked a question he raas his SC I'll also read it what are the practical applications for a PM okay what are the yeah of geni for pmo okay have you made a Playbook so far uh to answer to it in fact last series uh what we did was fully for a pmo and project manager context and that also we just showed how to work breakdown structure schedule okay as a demo but what we intend to do in January is uh an eight hours of prompt engineering for pmo and project managers so there in we would like to the participants to pick up uh a use case from their own company they from their own background and then start building right from the pre- project onwards uh until end of the project okay through maybe a series of uh business processes enabled through prompts so that uh in 8 hours they're able to have a a full experience of uh project uh plan development monitoring and then risk analysis uh Lessons Learned we would like to take the candidates through the entire cycle okay so it would be a a two session uh 4 plus4 two session Workshop that we are planning and these two webinars are only a more of a Prelude to that uh main Workshop so you can expect uh that to be a a full-fledged solution for pmo and project manager and uh with of course A playbook as well have I answered oh I'm so sorry yeah I hope I have answered your question uh thank you thank you Jes wonderful yeah uh as we keep talking uh the uh feedback is presented in the chat B uh please uh click and then uh fill in the feedback and yeah also have this Q yes sir sharing the QR code uh in the meantime others who have questions uh please raise your hands you can ask uh Jo you had a question sir uh my doubt is very much similar to Satya whether he he was talking about the aftermath of of a risk so my doubt is um the AI can sometimes know exaggerate or downplay the intensity of risk when we are ranking the I and impact of a risk so so what to do in that case I mean are industry specific so yeah so it's always uh our human judgment overrules everything what G does because it does maybe globally surveys and gets you but if you say that hey my company is unique and uh so we we all we need to do is uh just override and improvise on its recommendation so it can never replace us that's what I I mean what I'm trying to say this is uh I tell you organizations uh try to reinvent the wheel build their own applications their own okay brainstorming I know I myself worked with the company for 12 months to build uh a project management framework and at the end of it they could not even move one step forward okay that actually could have been done in one month itself okay if probably if we take help of this uh ready to deploy tools and with either copilot or chat GPT and if the organization has that intention and mindset to be agile and then start working on a new way of uh working so these things facilitates that good thank you for all your uh uh questions and then uh patient listening uh yeah still we'll keep this uh window open and any further questions you can ask uh please complete the feedback forms because only then we can recognize and then give you uh the pdu certificate download okay so you can for
