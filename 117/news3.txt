Tokyo’s New AI Traffic System Aims to Reduce Congestion and Emissions
Tokyo, October 30, 2024 — In a bold step toward sustainable urban planning, the City of Tokyo has announced plans to launch an AI-driven smart traffic management system next year. Using real-time data from vehicles, traffic cameras, and sensors, the AI system will optimize traffic flow, reduce delays, and improve public transportation schedules.

"With this system, we aim to make daily commuting faster and more efficient, while also reducing the city’s carbon emissions," explained Yuki Tanaka, head of Tokyo’s urban planning department. The AI traffic system is expected to be implemented in phases, starting in high-traffic areas. Once fully operational, it’s anticipated to enhance air quality and make Tokyo’s streets safer for all residents.
