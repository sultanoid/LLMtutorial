New Biodegradable Solar Panels Could Be Key to Truly Green Energy
Washington D.C., October 30, 2024 — Scientists at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have unveiled the world’s first fully biodegradable solar panels, offering a new solution to reduce environmental waste in renewable energy. Traditional solar panels are challenging to recycle, often containing harmful chemicals, while these new panels are made from organic materials that can naturally decompose.

Dr. Emily Zhao, who led the NREL team, stated, "This technology allows us to harness solar energy sustainably. We’re excited about the environmental benefits as we work toward mass production." The research team plans to scale up production in the coming year, with hopes that the innovation could lead to greener energy on a global scale.
